# Visa Application - Spain - BLS International - Egypt
This is the reflection of a DjangoCon EU 2024 confirmed speaker who couldn't give his talk because he couldn't secure a visa appointment via BLS International. After many painful weeks of nearly one-sided communication between myself on one side and BLS International and the Spanish Embassy on the other, this is what I think I should've done. I hope it can benefit whoever is reading this!

First things first, this is specific to **Egyptians** who'll apply through **BLS International**. Though most European embassies have similar middlemen, and from what I've heard, "they're all the same,"  I'm merely describing my experience.

So, straight to the topic, the most important thing to secure first is the travel permit. Believe it or not, if you get your visa application approved and delivered, you won't be able to board your plane without a travel permit. 

To get a travel permit, you have to either be exempted from military service or complete it. 

If you're a student, your fate at this step is in the hands of your university (unless you have a military exemption). Go to your information center or whatever and explain your situation clearly to get the travel permit. This is very important! This can also be very tough. I've seen people get their permits rejected because of unhinged deans or because someone from administration was having a bad day. Good luck!

Securing the permit should go in parallel with applying for the visa.

Now for the visa stuff!

There are two important papers you need to have. The first is the 6-month bank statement with lots of transactions. Why? This is basically proof that you won't illegally immigrate to Europe. You need to prove that you have assets and things to get back to Egypt. It's a little harsh, but it's the reality. And let's face it, we have lots of examples of people doing lots of tricks to illegally immigrate. This one is my favorite story: https://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/56/186166/Sports/Omni-sports/Mystery-lingers-over-how-Egyptian-blind-athletes-v.aspx  
> The truth is that Egyptian club El-Eman was supposed to feature in this tournament but pulled out at the last minute after 16 members of its delegation could not obtain their Schengen visas in time to make it to Poland.   
>   
> Twelve of those 16 members reportedly used the visas to infiltrate Europe and then vanished into thin air.

So, yeah, it's unfortunate, but you cannot blame them for this requirement..

The second-most important thing is the invitation letter. 

The rest is easy, I think.

While you're doing all of this, I suggest that you start booking an appointment! Yes, you heard me right! Your best-case scenario is a 3-month window to book the appointment and get your visa. BUT PLEASE, DON'T BOOK IT FROM THE WEBSITE! Here's how to book an appointment:  
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the website. BLS International changed their domain a lot, along with the customer support numbers.  
2. Book their Door-Step Services. You do that on the website. You'll hear back from them in 15–45 days. You won't get a confirmation email after you book the Door-Step Services. You can call them after one week to try to speed up the process.  
3. By the time they get back to you, you must've got all the documents related to the visa sorted (the travel permit is not important now).   
4. If everything is good, BLS will contact you to collect your application, and then it will be sent to the embassy.  
5. You'll hear back from the embassy in 15–45 days.

Any direct inquiry to the embassy, however urgent it is, will be replied to by an automated email referring back to BLS. I got that automated email more than I can count.

Contacting BLS via email is the worst thing ever. Their mail servers are crappy; you'll need to resend the mail multiple times. Call them, or even better, show up to their place and ask directly if it's feasible—they cannot escape you then!

Oh, I forgot to mention, you'll not get prioritized if you're a speaker at a big conference. It's the same process for everyone.

That's all I can remember. I sincerely wish you the best of luck <3
